/**
 * A desktop on which to place internal frames displaying Probe data.
 * <p>
 * There are some subtleties here that arise from the way Swing is implemented.
 * All Swing GUI events are processed on the "Swing event thread," and that
 * includes all methods of this object. This should be obvious for most
 * methods since they are called from GUI components such as Buttons.
 * <p>
 * The basic protocol of this module is simple. When a new Probe is requested
 * by a user command (such as a button click), the ProbeDesktop creates a
 * ProbeFrame where that Probe can be viewed.
